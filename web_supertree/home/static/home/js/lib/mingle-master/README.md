# Multilevel Agglomerative Edge Bundling in JavaScript

This is a JavaScript implementation of the paper [Multilevel Agglomerative Edge Bundling
for Visualizing Large Graphs](http://yifanhu.net/PUB/edge_bundling.pdf)
 (Emden R. Gansner, Yifan Hu, Stephen North, Carlos Scheidegger).

The edge bundling algorithm groups edges together to minimize the amount of
ink used to render a graph. This particular paper introduces a fast
technique to perform edge bundling.

Take for example this map connecting locations between the east coast in
the US and western Europe:

The algorithm creates a proximity graph for the edges where each of the
edges is represented by a node. Then the algorithm bundles edges as long
as we're saving some ink in the final rendering. Here's an intermediate
step on the bundling animation:

And here's the final result:

This implementation is solely based on the paper. The license for the code is MIT.

## Examples

This simple example shows links connecting locations in the Bay Area.
The rendering uses 2D Canvas but
could use any other rendering API.

## Usage

Given a dataset consisting of an Array of elements with format:

      {
          "id": <string id>,
          "name": <string name>,
          "data": {
              "coords": [
                  <coord x from>,
                  <coord y from>,
                  <coord x to>,
                  <coord y to>
              ]
          }
      }

Then the code to create the bundled edges graph is:

      var bundle = new Bundler();
      bundle.setNodes(json);
      bundle.buildNearestNeighborGraph();
      bundle.MINGLE();

Finally, to render the graph we provide some helper functions that make
use of 2D canvas:

      bundle.graph.each(function(node) {
        ctx.strokeStyle = 'rgba(0, 200, 200, 0.2)';
        ctx.lineWidth = 2;
        var edges = node.unbundleEdges(delta);
        Bundler.Graph.renderBezier(ctx, edges);
      });
